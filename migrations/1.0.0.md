# The big one...

OmniCore has been in beta development for a long, long time (since February 2023, and further back counting it's predecessors...) and is finally reaching it's boiling point for
a stable 1.0.0 release! This release is a major milestone for the project, and includes a lot of breaking changes, new features, and improvements.

Please read through all the changes below carefully, as almost every single facet of the project has been touched in some way and is guaranteed to break your mod.

## New Horizons!

We've finally started work on bringing our vast multi-version and multi-loader support to more than just simple utilities and rendering abstractions!
This means that, starting with 1.0.0, we will be including support for more content-creation APIs across multiple versions, such as items, blocks, entities, and more.
This is quite different to what we've done with the project thus far, and is a massive undertaking, but we believe that our stellar architecture and design will allow us to
deliver and incredible developer experience across a wide range of platforms.
